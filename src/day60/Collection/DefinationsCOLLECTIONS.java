public class DefinationsCOLLECTIONS {
    /*COLLECTIONS: stor multiple elements/objects in single unit

    why do we need arraylis/list: beacuse array is not resizible, modifible

    COLLECTION FRAMEWORK contain: 1.INTERFACE(functional part, what we do) 2.IMPLEMENTTIONS(performance part, how we do) 3.ALGORITHM

    Collection interfaces:
    List:  add/modify, including duplicates              (Arraylist/Linkedlist (these are subclass to implement)-implemetnation)
    Set: NO duplicates,. unique elements                                        (sortedSet-implemetnation)
    Queue: First in F out, Last in F out (who  ask first answer first)         (Dequeue-implemetnation)
    Map: key value pair (it means that get students and pair with same state), no dups  (HashMap-implemetnation)

    Collection is a super interface of List

    IMPORTANT: Collection framework:  you can access anything
                Collection interface: just one of the interface
                Collections class: it is a class like collections.sort
