package day48Interface;
//there are 3 type of files in Java

//1.class  2. interface  3. enum

public class Interface {

    //Defination: contract between a class and outside world.
      //example: keys on keyboard are an interface with the computer

    //public static final boolean STUDY_HALL=true; capital word mean that it is constant can not be changed

    //how to create INTERFACE: like a keyword interface. it is not a class it is just an interface. like final class

    //IMPLEMENTS: IT is like a super child class. but is just an interface
            // ex: public interface Teachable{
          //ex: public class Student implements Teachable{  . it means you inherit from Teachable class like an extends

    //both for Abstract and Interface, you can not create ab object out of it
}
